This project consisted of creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of our company. We were provided with a financial dataset, though a CSV file, which consisted of two columns, including the Date and Profit/Losses. Through this analysis, we were able to calculate the following:

        

 ***-The total number of months included in the dataset.***


***-The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.***


***-The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.***


***-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.***


***-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.***
